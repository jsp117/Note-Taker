# Note Taker

## Description
This application is a note taker deployed via Heroku. To create this application, I began by creating get, post and listen functions to display content to the site. The first .get /notes function displays the notes.html page when a user clicks get started on the home page. From there, I created a get function to display notes previously written to the db.json file. In order to save notes to an array and delete notes, I created the store.js file in which I created the class Store. In this class, there are methods to create and delete notes, and write them to the db.json file. In order to create unique ids, I utilized the uniqid npm package, which creates ids when called. I assigned these ids to each note as it is created, and also use them to delete specific notes when needed. 

Utilizing the Store class, I created the post function that takes the user inputted text and stores it using the createNote function within Store. Similarly, the delete functions uses the deleteNote function by id to delete notes from the array of notes, and then writes the new array to the db.json file.

You can then navigate on your browser to localhost:3000 to view the site. Click "get started" to navigate to the notes page. You can then type a title in the title text area, and a note in the note text area. From there, you can click the save icon on the top right to save your note. On the left hand side of the screen, you can click your previously saved notes to view them, or click the trash icon to delete them. To write a new note, you can click the pencil icon on the top right.
